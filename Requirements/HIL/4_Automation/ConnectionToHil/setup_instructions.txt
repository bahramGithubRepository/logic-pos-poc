# Instructions to set up Python virtual environment and install requirements

1. Open PowerShell and navigate to your project directory:
   cd "c:\Hilproject\hil-lab-prepration\4_Automation\ConnectionToHil"

2. Create a new virtual environment named 'venv':
   python -m venv venv

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate

4. Install the required packages from requirements.txt:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Set PYTHONPATH so pytest can find the modules
   set PYTHONPATH=%cd%

After these steps, your environment will be ready to run your project!

Note ! If you have installed gitlab runner on your computer and gitlab has run Veristand
make sure to terminate Veristand (background process) through Task Manager. Or vice versa
